## Description

Minitalk is a communication program using UNIX signals.

## Goals

To code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the 42cursus.


## Mandatory

â€¢ You must create a communication program in the form of a client and server.

â€¢ Communication between your programs should ONLY be done using UNIX signals.

â€¢ You can only use the two signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.


## Bonus

â€¢ The server confirms every signal received by sending a signal to the client.

â€¢ Support Unicode characters!


## Usage

To compile the program, run:

```
$ make
```

First, run the server and get its PID:
```
$ ./server
```
Then, run the client, providing the server PID and the string:
```
$ ./client 12345 "G'day mr server ðŸ™ƒ"
```
